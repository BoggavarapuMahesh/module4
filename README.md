1. `mintTokens`:
   - This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
   - The owner provides the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be minted.
   - The function internally calls the `_mint` function inherited from `ERC20` to create and assign the new tokens to the recipient.

2. `transferTokens`:
   - This function enables users to transfer their tokens from their address to a recipient's address.
   - Users specify the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be transferred.
   - The function checks if the sender's balance is sufficient to perform the transfer.
   - If the sender has enough tokens, the function calls the `_transfer` function inherited from `ERC20` to execute the transfer.

3. `checkBalance`:
   - This function allows users to check their token balance.
   - When a user calls this function, it returns the balance of tokens associated with the user's address.

4. `burnTokens`:
   - Users can burn their own tokens using this function.
   - Users provide the amount of tokens they want to burn.
   - The function verifies if the user has a sufficient token balance to perform the burn operation.
   - If the user has enough tokens, the function calls the `_burn` function inherited from `ERC20Burnable` to burn the specified amount of tokens.

5. `redeemGameItem`:
   - This function enables users to redeem game items using their tokens.
   - Users provide the index of the desired game item they want to redeem.
   - The function checks if the provided index is valid.
   - It also verifies if the user has a sufficient token balance to afford the game item.
   - If the conditions are met, the function transfers the required amount of tokens from the user to the contract owner, representing the redemption of the game item.

6. Game Items Information:
   - The contract maintains a list of predefined game items during deployment.
   - Each game item has a name and a price associated with it.
   - The `getGameItemCount` function returns the total count of available game items.
   - The `getGameItem` function accepts an index and returns the name and price of the game item at that index.

Token Functionality:
- The `DegenGamingToken` contract inherits from `ERC20` and `Ownable`, providing standard ERC20 token functionality and ownership control.
- The contract extends the `ERC20Burnable` contract to add the ability to burn tokens.
- Tokens are created during deployment, and the contract owner can mint additional tokens using the `mintTokens` function.
- Users can transfer their tokens using the `transferTokens` function, and their balances can be checked using `checkBalance`.
- Users can burn their tokens with the `burnTokens` function.
- The contract introduces the ability to redeem game items using tokens, with the redemption process handled by the `redeemGameItem` function.
- The contract also provides functions to retrieve information about available game items, such as the count and details of each item.
